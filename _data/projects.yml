- name: The UNSHARED Spectre
  descr: "This project was done in teams of 3. We explored effects of various changes in spectre attack. We also modified the attack to leak data from victim when there is no shared memory. This modification involved use of Prime+Probe to leak cache states."

- name: Exploring TLB Attacks
  descr: "This was my RnD Project done under guidance of <a href=\"https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/\">Prof. Biswabandan Panda</a>. As part of this project, I explored the possibility of exploiting <a href=\"\">amdprefetch</a> attack on recent processors. I also explored the TLB reverse engineering described in <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/tatar\">TLB;DR: Desynchronized Reversing</a> which utilizes the fact that memory and TLB are not synchronized to get higher accuracy results"

- name: Process Fingerprinting
  descr: "This was my RnD Project done under guidance of <a href=\"https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/\">Prof. Biswabandan Panda</a>. As part of this project, I first read about the <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3470496.3527416\">Website Fingerprinting</a> which analyses and proves that interrupts cause the leakage in <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec19-shusterman.pdf\">this</a> and not the cache as was said in the paper. Later, we explored the possibility of using this interrupt side channel to break VM isolation and leak the processes being run across the VM layer. This was started by <a href=\"https://in.linkedin.com/in/girish-srivatsa-43534b196\">Girish Srivatsa</a> and Prajith and later continued by me and <a href=\"https://sroy729.github.io/yupp/\">Shubham Roy</a>"

- name: FastChat
  descr: "A fast, secure chatting application. <br>
    In this project, we (team of 3) built a chatting application with End-to-End Encryption. It also supported Group Chats. We used sockets and selectors primitives in python for communication channels and server handling respectively. We also implemented various load-balancer techniques. We compared various load-balancing mechanisms by performance analysis using 100 clients connecting to 5 servers."
