- name: The UNSHARED Spectre
  descr: "This project was done in teams of 3. We explored effects of various changes in spectre attack. We also modified the attack to leak data from victim when there is no shared memory. This modification involved use of Prime+Probe to leak cache states."

- name: FastChat
  descr: "A fast, secure chatting application. <br>
    In this project, we (team of 3) built a chatting application with End-to-End Encryption. It also supported Group Chats. We used sockets and selectors primitives in python for communication channels and server handling respectively. We also implemented various load-balancer techniques. We compared various load-balancing mechanisms by performance analysis using 100 clients connecting to 5 servers."
